> A collection of machine learning models implemented from scratch

## Motivation
The models implemented here are for my own learning purposes and that of others. They are not in any way intended for real world use.

## Inspiration
The implementation of these models is inspired by [Deep Learning](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/), an outstanding textbook from Bengio and Goodfellow.
